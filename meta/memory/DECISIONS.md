# DECISION-002
DECISION-ID: DECISION-002
Topic: AI repository governance and COO documentation gate
Decision: Adopt AI_CONSTITUTION.md as the authoritative repository governance model. AI CEO/CIO retains strategic decision authority; AI COO owns execution, repository health, verification, and documentation. No meaningful task may be reported COMPLETE while required documentation is missing.
Confidence: HIGH
Evidence IDs: GOV-001, GOV-002
Status: LOCKED
Reopen Conditions: Reopen only if the Human Owner changes the governance model or an authoritative repository decision supersedes it.

# DECISION-003
DECISION-ID: DECISION-003
Topic: PR audit disposition on 2026-09-30
Decision: Merge focused PR #141 after verification; close duplicate PR #150; keep #145, #146, #155, #156, and #142 open pending current-main revalidation and reconciliation where changes overlap. Vercel deployment-rate-limit failures are treated as infrastructure conditions, not code-quality evidence.
Confidence: HIGH
Evidence IDs: PR-141, PR-142, PR-145, PR-146, PR-150, PR-155, PR-156, MAIN-20260930
Status: LOCKED
Reopen Conditions: Reopen if current-main revalidation, CI evidence, or contributor changes materially alter the technical assessment.
