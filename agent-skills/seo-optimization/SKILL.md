## Description
Audit and improve supplied page content against explicit search, metadata, linking, and technical constraints.

## When to Use
Use when page content, target query, and optimization constraints are available.

## Inputs / Outputs / Failure Modes
| Area | Contract |
|---|---|
| Inputs | Source material, domain context, task constraints, and required output format. |
| Outputs | Structured result with provenance, assumptions, uncertainty, and validation findings where material. |
| Failure modes | Missing context, stale/conflicting evidence, unsupported inference, malformed output, or skipped verification. |

## Procedure
1. Establish task scope, source boundaries, and required output schema.
2. Validate that the source material and domain context are sufficient.
3. Produce the result while preserving source meaning and separating evidence from inference.
4. Validate calculations, claims, citations, constraints, and required fields.
5. Escalate material ambiguity instead of inventing missing facts.

## Runnable Example
```python
task = {"capability": "seo-optimization", "validated": True}
assert task["validated"]
result = {"status": "review_required", "capability": task["capability"]}
print(result)
```

## Failure Modes
- Missing or ambiguous source context.
- Unsupported domain inference.
- Stale, conflicting, or unverifiable evidence.
- Presenting generated output as authoritative professional advice.
- Skipping validation or provenance checks.

## Domain Boundary
SEO recommendations are not guarantees of rankings; validate technical recommendations against current search-engine guidance.

## Evidence
Canonical repository skill: this file. Structural conformance is defined by the repository schema, validation workflows, Agent Skills contract, and security gates. Domain-specific factual claims must remain traceable to supplied or independently verified authoritative sources.
